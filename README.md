# GUI-Calculator

In this project, I have written a GUI calculator in Java, which contains the buttons and display area. Users can control this calculator with mouse.  
In the calculator, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are avalable in basic calculation.
I am trying to update the calculator to be applicable with keyboard.
